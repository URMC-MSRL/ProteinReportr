Description: Using output from the Perseus proteomics make, create a deliverable excel report. Has columns for protein annotation data (protein name, uniprot accession, and gene name), number of peptides quantified, median protein abundance for each group, p-value from a student's t-test, log2 fold change, and normalized protein abundance (Protein Group MaxLFQ) for each sample. The header is separated from the data by a heavy bottom and and each main category aer separated by a heavy horizontal line.
